The web browser is implemented with GUI in tkinter and which gets the desired information from the server.

Base code I used for this project. Code shown in video is what I configured. Original code lost to corrupted disk. 

In this code I had linked users to different website based on a keyword filter. This would lead them to the search results of either the websites Twitter, Facebook, or Tik Tok. Each keyword corresponded to what I thought was the description most aligned with the website's values thus creating a filtered word search based off the algorithm of each website.
